Hi Alex Costan,

I am Jaibert Padilla on freelancer.com.
I finished Twilio and I was going to send you message in Freelancer, but my account was closed right now. I lost all money in freelancer. :(
I don't know why. I am contacting support team.
By the way, I think it's better to have a chat and continue project on skype or other app at the moment.
What do you think?
Plz let me know your contactable information, so we can continue working together.

My eamil is seniordev0909@outlook.com.
My Skype is live:.cid.2518d2d607f8bba1

Hope to hear from you soon.
I will wait for you in Skype.

Best,
Jaibert
